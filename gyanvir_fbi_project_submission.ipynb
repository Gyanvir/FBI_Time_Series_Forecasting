    "I built a machine-learning pipeline to forecast monthly crime volumes by type, helping law enforcement allocate resources more effectively. We started by exploring over 200,000 incident records—each with date, time, location, and crime category. Through univariate, bivariate, and multivariate charts, we uncovered strong seasonal patterns (summer crime peaks, winter lows), daily rhythms (late-afternoon surges), and spatial hotspots in downtown and transit areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we cleaned the data—treating zero coordinates as missing, filling unknown neighborhoods, and capping extreme latitude/longitude values at their 1st/99th percentiles to avoid skew. We engineered features that any agency would find intuitive: cyclic hour and weekday transforms (so midnight/11 PM are “close”), distance from the city center, and encoded crime types and month-of-year.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then aggregated incidents into monthly counts for each crime type—the exact format your deployment team needs—and split the data into train and validation sets. We trained two tree-based models: Random Forest and XGBoost. Each underwent cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning (grid search for RF, randomized search for XGBoost). On validation, XGBoost achieved a mean absolute error of about 10 incidents per month and an average percentage error (MAPE) under 5%, outperforming Random Forest by a small but meaningful margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explain our “black-box” model, we plotted feature importances: crime type (encoded) was the top driver, followed by seasonality features, with year (trend) ranking third. This confirmed that different crimes follow distinct seasonal cycles—burglary surges in July, theft spikes in December—affirming our approach’s business value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we packaged the pipeline to retrain on all historical data and produce next-year’s forecasts in a single executable notebook, ready for deployment. A final_submission.csv matches the given test schema, so integrating into an operations dashboard is straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key impacts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Targeted patrols: Agencies can concentrate on high-crime types and months, reducing wasted overtime.\n",
    "    Seasonal staffing: With clear summer/winter patterns, budgets can flex up or down.\n",
    "    Data-driven planning: Spatial insights enable camera and lighting investments where they matter most."
